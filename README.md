Genetic Exploration of Type 2 Diabetes using Data Mining
Developed a comprehensive data mining approach to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between diabetic and non-diabetic samples. Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering to analyze gene expression patterns. Constructed and evaluated classification models including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic samples.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, PCA, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.
